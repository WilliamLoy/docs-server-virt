Log in to the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal
==================================================

After we build your environment to your specifications, you receive 
an email that includes your username and password to 
the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal (MyRackspace Portal)[link].

To get started, we recommend reviewing the contents of the Customer 
Portal Onboarding Guide (https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/portal-onboarding-guide/)[link]. 
The portal onboarding guide shows you how to create tickets, 
manage notifications, and perform several administrative tasks.
