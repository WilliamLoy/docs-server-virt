=========================
Manage hypervisor storage
=========================

The amount and type of storage you require on a hypervisor can change 
over time based on your storage needs. To accommodate additional applications 
and data, you can expand LUNs, local storage, and a VMFS datastore. 

While we cannot automatically shrink storage resources, we do provide a 
workaround for situations where you need to reduce storage capacity.

This section includes the following topics:

* Expand LUNs 
* Shrink hypervisor storage
* Expand VMFS datastore
* Manage host bus adapters
