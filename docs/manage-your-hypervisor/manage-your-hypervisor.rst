Manage your hypervisor
======================

Managing your hypervisor includes managing your vSphere hosts, 
ESXi hosts, hardware, networking, and storage.

In most cases, you must open a Rackspace Technology ticket and 
request that we complete a task for you. For tasks that you 
cannot complete, the following documentation provides a list of 
what you should include in the Rackspace Technology ticket so 
we can expedite your request. 

This chapter includes the following sections:

* Manage vSphere clusters
* Upgrade ESXi version
* Manage hypervisor hardware
* Manage hypervisor networking
* Manage hypervisor storage
* Plan hypervisor capacity
