Manage your hypervisor
======================

Managing your hypervisor includes managing your vSphere hosts,
ESXi hosts, hardware, networking, and storage.

In most cases, you must open a Rackspace Technology ticket and
request that we complete a task for you. For tasks that you cannot
complete, the following documentation provides a list of what you
should include in the Rackspace Technology ticket so we can expedite
your request.
