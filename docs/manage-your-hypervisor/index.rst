Manage your hypervisor
======================

Managing your hypervisor includes managing your vSphere hosts,
ESXi hosts, hardware, networking, and storage.

In most cases, you must open a Rackspace Technology ticket and
request that we complete a task for you. For tasks that you cannot
complete, the following documentation provides a list of what you
should include in the Rackspace Technology ticket so we can expedite
your request. 

This chapter includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Manage vSphere clusters <manage-vsphere-clusters>`
- :ref:`Upgrade ESXi version <upgrade-esxi-version>`
- :ref:`Manage hypervisor hardware <manage-hypervisor-hardware>`
- :ref:`Manage hypervisor networking <manage-hypervisor-networking>`
- :ref:`Manage hypervisor storage <manage-hypervisor-storage>`
