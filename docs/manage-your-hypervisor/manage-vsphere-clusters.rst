======================
Manage your hypervisor
======================

Members of a vSphere cluster, a collection of ESXi hypervisors, pool 
their resources with a single VM drawing resources from one hypervisor 
at a time. All cluster members have either identical, or in some cases 
similar, configurations.

This section includes the following topics:

* View vSphere clusters
* Configure the distributed resource scheduler
* Configure high availability
* Distributed power management
* Add a resource pool
