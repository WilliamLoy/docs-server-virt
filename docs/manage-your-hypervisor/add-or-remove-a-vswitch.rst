=======================
Add or remove a vSwitch
=======================

A vSwitch, a virtual switch that provides a link between uplinks and port 
groups, can use multiple uplinks and manage multiple port groups. Refer to 
Understanding vSwitches[link] for more information about vSwitches.

To add or remove a vSwitch, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and 
request a consultation.

**Note:** We cannot remove switches that we have pre-configured for you.
