==================
Manage port groups
==================

A port group is a logical construct on the vSwitch to which vNICs can connect. 
Refer to Understanding port groups[link] for more information about 
port groups. 

We manage port groups for you, including:

* Adding port groups
* Removing port groups
* Editing a VLAN ID
* Renaming a port group.
  
If you require us to take any of the preceding actions, open a 
Rackspace Technology ticket and indicate what action you want us to perform.

**Note:** Some port group tasks might require a maintenance window.
