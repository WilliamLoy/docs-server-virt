Manage hypervisor hardware
==========================

If required, we can add RAM and CPU resources to your hypervisor based
on your business requirements. As your business grows and you add
applications, your hypervisor might require additional RAM and CPU.
In addition, we can perform routine maintenance on the hypervisor chassis.

This section includes the following topics:

- :ref:`Add RAM to a hypervisor <add-ram-to-a-hypervisor>`
- :ref:`Upgrade CPU in a hypervisor <upgrade-cpu-in-a-hypervisor>`
- :ref:`Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis <migrate-to-a-new-hypervisor-chassis>`

.. _add-ram-to-a-hypervisor:




Add Ram to a hypervisor
_______________________


You can add RAM to your hypervisor, which can enhance system performance.
Adding RAM results in increased cost for each hypervisor. When you add
RAM to a hypervisor, you must also add RAM to all hypervisors in
the cluster, if applicable.

To add RAM to your hypervisor, contact your Rackspace Technology
account team. We undertake this work in a planned maintenance window.





.. _upgrade-cpu-in-a-hypervisor:



Upgrade CPU in a hypervisor
___________________________


You can swap out the processor on your hypervisor to add more
CPU resources, which can enhance system performance. Adding CPU
resources results in increased costs for each hypervisor and
Guest OS licensing. When you add CPU resources to a hypervisor,
you must also add CPU resources to all hypervisors in the cluster,
if applicable.

To add CPU resources to your hypervisor, contact your Rackspace Technology
account team. We undertake this work in a planned maintenance window.





.. _migrate-to-a-new-hypervisor-chassis:




Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis
___________________________________


Subject to compatibility, terms, and cost, we can migrate your environment
to a different Hypervisor chassis. You might need to migrate to
a new chassis to run the latest version of ESXi, support the most
recent driver, or when the current chassis has reached end-of-support.

Depending on the impact to your environment, we can migrate your chassis
during a planned maintenance window or as an emergency change. If your
hypervisor belongs to a cluster, you must migrate all hypervisors in the
cluster to a new chassis.

To migrate your hypervisor to a new chassis, contact your
Rackspace Technology account team.





.. _request-hypervisor-hardware-maintenance:



Request hypervisor hardware maintenance
_______________________________________



Subject to compatibility, terms, and cost, we can perform routine hardware
maintenance tasks on your hypervisor chassis, including upgrading firmware,
managing the local RAID array, and replacing the battery.

To request maintenance, contact your Rackspace Technology account team.
We complete chassis-related work during a planned maintenance window.
