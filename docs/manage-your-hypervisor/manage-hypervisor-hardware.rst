Manage hypervisor hardware
==========================

If required, we can add RAM and CPU resources to your hypervisor based on 
your business requirements. As your business grows and you add applications, 
your hypervisor might require additional RAM and CPU. In addition, 
we can perform routine maintenance on the hypervisor chassis.

This section includes the following topics:

* Add RAM to a hypervisor
* Upgrade CPU in a hypervisor
* Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis
