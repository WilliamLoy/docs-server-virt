=====================
Expand VMFS datastore
=====================

When we expand a LUN [link[]], we must also expand the VMFS datastore. 
You can use the additional space to expand or add vDisks.

If your datastore was previously over-allocated before the expansion, 
then the amount of useable new space might be less than you expect. 
For more information about datastore overhead requirements, 
refer to Datastore overhead requirements [link].

If you want us to expand a VMFS datastore, open a Rackspace Technology 
ticket and provide the datastore name and the amount by which you want 
to expand it.
