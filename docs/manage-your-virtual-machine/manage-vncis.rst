============
Manage vNCIs
============

VMs typically include the following two virtual network interface 
cards [link](vNIC):

* **Public interface:** The public interface vNIC is the primary connection.
* **Dedicated backup network interface:** If you subscribe to 
  the Rackspace Technology managed backup service, the dedicated backup 
  network vNIC is used for file backup traffic.

While you cannot manage a vNIC yourself, we provide a list of information 
for the following tasks that you should include in your ticket so that we 
can expedite your request.

This section includes the following topics:

•	Add a vNIC
•	Remove a vNIC
•	Change the association between a vNIC a port group
•	Change vNIC type
•	Connect or disconnect a vNIC
