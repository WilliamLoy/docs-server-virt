A vDisk is a virtual disk that the Guest OS uses for storage as it would 
use a physical disk. A vDisk is represented as a **.vmdk** file on a VMFS 
datastore.

While you cannot manage a vDisk yourself, we provide a list of information 
for the following tasks, which you should include in your ticket so that 
we can expedite your request. 

This section includes the following topics:

* Add vDisk
* Delete vDisk
* Detach vDisk
