Manage Rackspace Technology Portal users
========================================

Because the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal supports multiple
offerings, we have documented the instructions for managing users in a
separate guide. Refer to
`Manage user permissions for Dedicated Hosting
<https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/manage-user-permissions-for-dedicated-hosting/>`_.
for instructions about managing user permissions.
