Credentials management
======================

For supported VMs and in accordance with ISO27001 requirements, 
we maintain a formal policy for credentials to your environment. 
These credentials give us the ability to provide managed services 
and enable automation. 

While you have full administrator access to modify VM passwords and 
accounts as necessary, we advise against making changes to 
the Rackspace Technology account to avoid impacting your support 
experience. If you do make changes, open a ticket to ensure that 
we are aware of the changes.
