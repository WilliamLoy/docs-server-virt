=========================
Maintain your environment
=========================

To reduce the risk of certain change requests, Rackspace Technology or 
customers can recommend that certain functions occur in a scheduled 
maintenance. These scheduled maintenances ensure that the following 
are available to the customer:

* Reserved Rackspace Technology resources to complete the defined tasks of 
  the maintenance.
* Documented maintenance preparation and quality checks from all departments 
  involved in the maintenance.
* Defined length of maintenance to accomplish the defined tasks.
* Documented rollback plan in the event of unforeseen circumstances during 
  execution.

Because we cannot confirm the full scope of a maintenance until we complete 
all quality checks, Rackspace Technology schedules only after all quality 
checks have passed.

Because we base the maintenance calendar scheduling on availability of all 
teams involved, we accept reservations on a first-come, first-served basis. 
However, if this maintenance is urgent or if there is a limited timeline in 
which to execute it, contact your account team to see if we can accommodate 
your need.
