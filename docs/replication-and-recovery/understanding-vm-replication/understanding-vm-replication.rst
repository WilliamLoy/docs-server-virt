Understanding VM replication
============================

VM Replication Enhanced Edition, powered by the Zerto® IT
Resilience Platform™, delivers a fully managed always-on experience.
With Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
measured in seconds and minutes, VM replication provides near-continuous
storage-agnostic data replication enabling the recovery of VMs from
business-impacting events such as ransomware, hardware failures,
or natural disasters. VM Replication offers both local and
remote replication.

This section includes the following topics:

* Understanding VM replication key features
* Understanding VM replication architecture
* Understanding how VM replication protection works
* Understanding Remote Edition Initial Synchronization
* Understanding Remote Edition Continuous Replication
* Understanding VPGs
* Understanding test operations
* Understanding failover operations
* Understanding VM replication roles and responsibilities

**Note:** You cannot configure VMs that have one of the following
characteristics for a source VM:

* Active Directory VMs (We support and recommend Active Directory
  native replication.)
* VMs with raw device mappings (RDMs).
* Multi-write disk mode.
* Oracle clusters.
* RHEL clusters.
