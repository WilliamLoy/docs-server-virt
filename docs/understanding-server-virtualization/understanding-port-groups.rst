Understanding port groups
=========================

A port group is a logical construct on the vSwitch to which vNICs can 
connect. A port group typically has a name and a VLAN ID. You can see 
the port group name shown as a network in the VMware Server Virtualization 
section of the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal.

One port group can serve multiple vNICs.
